//Take up to 10 minutes to write a function called enrollInSummerSchool
//that takes a single argument, students.
//students is an array of objects, with each object representing a student â€” 
//for example, {name: 'Tim', status: 'Current student', course: 'Biology'}.
//
//enrollInSummerSchool should return an array of objects.
//For each object from the original array,
//it should return the original name and course,
//but should update the status to In Summer school. So, given this input:
